# Mockito

### What is Mockito?

**Mockito** is a mocking framework, JAVA-based library that is used for effective unit testing of JAVA applications. **Mockito** is used to mock interfaces so that a dummy functionality can be added to a mock interface that can be used in unit testing. 

​	A mock object returns a dummy data and avoids external dependencies. It simplifies the development of tests by mocking external dependencies and apply the mocks into the code under test. 



#### Why we need Mockito?

- setup test, create scenarios is time consuming
- Avoids external dependencies
